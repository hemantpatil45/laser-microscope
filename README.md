# DIY Microscope using Laser and Syringe Lens

This repository documents a simple DIY microscope project I created in 9th grade using easily available components. The goal was to observe micro-scale objects without using a commercial microscope.

## 🔧 Components Used
- 5 mL plastic syringe (used to create a convex water lens)
- Laser pointer (for illumination)
- Smartphone (camera for magnified image capture)
- Cardboard, glue, and clips for alignment and mounting

## 🔍 Features
- Magnification of small samples like fibers, plant cells, and insects
- Portable and low-cost
- Educational project to understand light focusing and microscopy

## 🧪 Learnings
- Basic optics and magnification
- DIY construction and iterative design
- Creative use of household components for scientific experiments

## 📸 Gallery
[Insert images or videos of setup and captured microscope images]

## 📄 Future Ideas
- Replace laser with LED for safer illumination
- Use 3D-printed parts for stability
- Integrate with smartphone app for better focusing
