# DIY Laser Microscope

This is a simple microscope I built in 9th grade using a laser pointer, lenses, and a smartphone camera. The project demonstrates basic optical magnification using low-cost components.

## Objective
To create a budget-friendly microscope using laser light to observe small objects such as cloth fibers or plant cells.

## Components Used
- Laser pointer (red)
- Convex lens (from old phone camera)
- Mobile phone camera
- DIY mount or stand (cardboard or plastic)
- Transparent slide or plastic sheet

## Working Principle
Laser light is directed at the object placed on a transparent slide. A convex lens focuses the reflected light onto the mobile phone camera, which captures the magnified view. By adjusting the distance between the lens and the object, the focus and magnification can be tuned.

## Project Setup
1. Fix the laser pointer to shine on the object.
2. Place the lens between the object and the camera.
3. Adjust distances for best magnification.
4. Use a mobile phone camera to capture or view the image.

## Images
(Add your setup images here: `images/laser_setup.jpg`, `images/magnified_sample.jpg`, etc.)

## Learnings
- Basic principles of optics and lenses
- How to align laser beams for precision
- Creativity and hands-on problem-solving

## Built In
9th Standard (School Project)
